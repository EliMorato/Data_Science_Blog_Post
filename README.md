# Data_Science_Blog_Post

## Motivation
The objective of this project is to get useful information from the Seattle Airbnb data. I decided to obtain from the data some basic tips to start being a profitable Airbnb host in Seattle.

## Libraries used
To achieve that goal, I used the following libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, string, sklearn and mpl_toolkits.

## Files in repository
The files that can be found in this repository are the notebook with all the steps to get tha data visualization and a .zip with the shapefile to be able to plot the shape of the neighborhoods in the last visualization (the Seattle's map). This shapefile was obtained from the Seattle's official site that you can find in the next link: https://data.seattle.gov/dataset/Neighborhoods/2mbt-aqqx

## Summary of results
The results obtained from the analysis are four visualizations of the Seattle data that lead to some observations described in the Medium post (https://medium.com/@e.pinomorato/tips-to-start-a-profitable-airbnb-in-seattle-bb773796cef8). 
This are the visualizations:

The graphics show the clear difference between the mean prices of the best apartments and the others.

Here we can see the difference of occupation rate between the best and the non best apartments.

This is the visualizaton of the most important words between the two groups of data.

This image is useful to show the similar distribution between the best apartments and the others, showing the little importance of the location when it comes to rate a host.
