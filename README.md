# Data_Science_Blog_Post

The objective of this project is to get useful information from the Seattle Airbnb data. I decided to obtain from the data some basic tips to start being a profitable Airbnb host in Seattle.

To achieve that goal, I used the following libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, string, sklearn and mpl_toolkits.

The files that can be found in this repository are the notebook with all the steps to get tha data visualization and a .zip with the shapefile to be able to plot the shape of the neighborhoods in the last visualization (the Seattle's map). This shapefile was obtained from the Seattle's official site that you can find in the next link: https://data.seattle.gov/dataset/Neighborhoods/2mbt-aqqx

The results obtained from the analysis are four visualizations of the Seattle data that lead to some observations described in the Medium post (https://medium.com/@e.pinomorato/tips-to-start-a-profitable-airbnb-in-seattle-bb773796cef8). This are the visualizations:
